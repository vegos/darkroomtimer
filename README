Darkroom Timer

A very simple but useful timer for enlarger.

It's Arduino-based, and it consists of a 7 Segment Display (I2C), an Encoder,
a switch and a relay.

Note: I use a *RED* 7 Segment Display (you don't need light when you print your
photos :))

When powered, you can change the time with the encoder (MM:SS).
When click on the encoder (switch) the timer starts.
It turns on the enlarger (via the relay) and on the display it's counting down
time left.
The second switch it turns on the enlarger manually (for focusing). 
It's better to use a on/off switch.

When the encoder is long-pressed, the time is saved on EEPROM, so it can be 
used next time as default.
